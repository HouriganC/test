# The black-eyed pea
Black-eyed peas or cowpeas (_Vigna unguicultata_ L. Walp) are wonder plants! Let's all eat black-eyed peas!

## Introduction
The cowpea (_Vigna unguiculata_) is an annual herbaceous legume from the genus <span data-click-image-zoomto="309,625,510,412"> _Vigna_ </span>. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall, it is an important crop in the semiarid regions across Africa and Asia. It requires very few inputs, as the plant's root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource-poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.

## Taxonomy
_Vigna unguiculata_ is a member of the _Vigna_ (peas and beans) genus. Unguiculata is Latin for "with a small claw", which reflects the small stalks on the flower petals.[7] Common names for cultivated cowpeas include; black-eye pea,[8] southern pea,[9] niebe[10] (alternatively ñebbe),[11] and crowder pea.[12] All cultivated cowpeas are found within the universally accepted V. unguiculata subspecies unguiculata classification, which is then commonly divided into four cultivar groups: unguiculata, biflora, sesquipedalis, and textilis.[13][14] The classification of the wild relatives within V. unguiculata is more complicated, with over 20 different names having been used and between 3 and 10 subgroups described.[13][15] The original subgroups of stenophylla, dekindtiana, and tenuis appear to be common in all taxonomic treatments, while the variations pubescens and protractor were raised to subspecies level by a 1993 characterisation

## Origins

Compared to most other important crops, little is known about the domestication, dispersal, and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation, the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.

## Cultivation
Cowpeas thrive in poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand.[30] This makes them a particularly important crop in arid, semidesert regions where not many other crops will grow. As well as an important source of food for humans in poor, arid regions, the crop can also be used as feed for livestock.[31] Its nitrogen-fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava, or cotton.Seeds from the wild-type cowpea are much smaller than the cultivated varieties
The optimum temperature for cowpea growth is 30 °C (86 °F), making it only available as a summer crop for most of the world. It grows best in regions with an annual rainfall between 400 and 700 mm (16 and 28 in). The ideal soils are sandy and it has better tolerance for infertile and acid soil than most other crops. Generally, 133,000 seeds are planted per hectare (54,000/acre) for the erect varieties and 60,000 per hectare (24,000/acre) for the climbing and trailing varieties. The seeds can be harvested after about 100 days or the whole plant used as forage after about 120 days. Leaves can be picked from 4 weeks after planting
